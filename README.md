# WebGL EWA Splatter

An elliptical weighted average (EWA) surface splatter, implemented in WebGL.
This implements the papers: *Object Space EWA Surface Splatting: A Hardware Accelerated Approach to High Quality Point Rendering*
by Ren, Pfister and Zwicker, and *High-Quality Point-Based Rendering on Modern GPUs* by Botsch and Kobbelt, with a few shortcuts.

Uses [glMatrix](http://glmatrix.net/) for math operations.
